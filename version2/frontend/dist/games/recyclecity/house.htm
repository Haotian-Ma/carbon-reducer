	<div><img src="images/clothesline.gif" alt="Clothesline in backyard" width="163" height="135" class="img-l" /></div>
	<h3>Clothesline</h3>
	<p>When the weather is clear, the Savemors hang clothes on the line to dry. It saves energy and makes the clothes smell great.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="compostbin" style="width:600px;">
	<div><img src="images/compostbin.gif" alt="Compost Bin in backyard" class="img-l" /></div>
	<h3>Compost Bin</h3>
	<p>Sidney and Sheila built a compost bin in the yard after hearing about how to do it in school. They use the bin to recycle grass and yard trimmings, and also add coffee grounds, egg shells, and vegetable trimmings from the kitchen. As the waste degrades and turns into compost, they use it to help their garden grow.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="bicycle" style="width:700px;">
	<div><img src="images/bike.gif" alt="bicycle in the garage" class="img-l" /></div>
	<h3>Bicycles</h3>
	<p>While they sometimes need to use their car, the Savemor family tries as much as possible to use bicycles to get from place to place. Bikes don't pollute or use non-renewable fuels&mdash;and they're good exercise.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="reusable" style="width:700px;">
 <h3>Reusable Items</h3>
 <img src="images/reusable.gif" alt="Reusable Items" class="img-r" />
 <p>The Savemors hold a garage sale twice a year to sell usable things that they no longer want or need. That way, they not only help the environment, they make money, too!</p>
 <p>In addition, they know that many everyday items&mdash;such as bags, plastic containers, and coffee cans&mdash;can be used more than once. As part of a project for Miss Redux at school, Sheila and Sidney came up with ideas for how some things can be reused at home:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Paper and plastic bags can be saved and used to clean up around the house or taken to the store on the next shopping trip. Brown paper bags are great for wrapping packages to be shipped.</li>
  <li>Paper and envelopes can be reused to write notes or make lists before being recycled.</li>
  <li>Gift boxes can be used again as well as larger pieces of wrapping paper, tissue paper, ribbons and bows.</li>
  <li>Packaging, colored paper, egg cartons and other items can be used for arts and crafts projects at school, day care or senior citizen centers.</li>
  <li>Newspaper, packaging &quot;peanuts,&quot; and bubble wrap can be reused to ship packages.</li>
  <li>Glass and plastic jars, milk jugs, coffee cans and other kinds of containers can be washed and used to store leftovers, buttons, nails, or thumbtacks. Empty coffee cans can be turned into flower pots.</li>
  <li>Used wood can be made into birdhouses, mailboxes, compost bins, garden borders or other woodworking projects.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>BUT motor oil cans or pesticide containers CANNOT be reused because they contain harmful residues. They must be discarded following the manufacturers' instructions on the label.</p>  
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="homemadecleaners" style="width:700px;">
<h3>Homemade Cleaners</h3> <img src="images/homecleaners.gif" alt="Mopping the kitchen floor" class="img-r" />
  
 <p>Although sometimes they can't find a safe substitute for a toxic cleanser, the Savemors have found a number of ways to use safer alternatives. (When they can't find a safe substitute, they use as little of the toxic substance as possible to do the job.) Some alternatives they use are:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Natural biodegradable cleaners, or 4 tsp. of baking soda in warm water instead of general-purpose cleaners</li>
  <li>Vinegar and salt instead of heavy-duty cleaners for surfaces</li>
  <li>One-half cup of white vinegar followed by one handful of baking soda instead of drain cleaners</li>
  <li>Biodegradable cleaners instead of harsh oven cleaners (for fresh spills, wet and sprinkle baking soda and scrub with soft nylon scrubber)</li>
  <li>Vinegar and water to clean walls, floors and glass instead of special cleaners</li>
  <li>One teaspoon of olive oil mixed with juice of one lemon and one teaspoon of water instead of furniture polish</li>
  <li>Opening the windows or setting out an open box of baking soda instead of using air fresheners&hellip;. or simmering cloves and cinnamon in boiling water</li>
 </ul>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="appliances" style="width:700px;">
 <h3>Appliances</h3> <img src="images/apps.gif" alt="Kitchen Appliances" class="img-r" />
  
 <p>The Savemors keep all home appliances, like the refrigerator, in good working order. They follow the manufacturer's suggestions for proper operation and maintenance.</p>
 <p>When old appliances need to be replaced, Sue and Seymour always check the energy efficiency on the new appliance. They also buy appliances that offer a longer life span and a good warranty or repair policy. The longer the appliances last, the more the Savemors save.</p>
 <p>When an old appliance has to go, they call local recyclers who pick it up and use it for scrap.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="bins" style="width:600px;">
 <div><img src="images/bins.gif" alt="Recycling Bins out front on trash day" class="img-l" /></div>
 <h3>Recycling Bins</h3>
 <p>The Savemors keep recycling bins in the kitchen so no one accidentally forgets and throws something into the trash that could be recycled. They recycle plastic, glass, paper, and aluminum and other metal cans.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="source" style="width:700px;">
 <h3>Source Reduction</h3>
 <div><img src="images/source.gif" alt="Mail carrier walking up to house" class="img-r" /></div>
 <p>The Savemor family knows that the best way to manage waste is to reduce it at the source. If you don't buy it, you won't have to throw it away. Here are some things the Savemors do to reduce waste:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>They contact companies to let them know they don't want to receive unwanted advertising mail. They ask companies not to share their names with other mailers. They also can request to be removed from mailing lists by visiting <a href="https://www.dmachoice.org/">www.dmachoice.org</a> or <a href="https://www.catalogchoice.org/">www.catalogchoice.org</a>.</li>
  <li>They rent, borrow, or share items that they use infrequently, such as rug shampooers, ladders, chain saws, floor buffers, or garden tillers.</li>
  <li>They contact manufacturers to encourage them to reduce unnecessary packaging.</li>
  <li>They find safer alternatives to potentially hazardous household materials, such as oven cleaners and polishes.</li>
  <li>They buy the products they use a lot in bulk instead of in smaller quantities.</li>
 </ul>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="grass" style="width:700px;">
	<div><img src="images/gcycle.gif" alt="Lawn mowing with a push mower" class="img-l" /></div>
	<h3>Grass-cycling</h3>
	<p>Whenever the Savemors cut the grass, they leave the grass clippings on the lawn instead of raking them up and putting them in bags. It's called grasscycling. It's good for the lawn because the grass breaks down and all the nutrients from the clippings go right back into the soil.</p>
	<p>Because the lawn is receiving these nutrients, it doesn't need chemical fertilizers or even as much water. So, the Savemors save money, time, and energy&mdash;and keep all those bags of grass clippings out of the Recycle City landfill!</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="swing" style="width:500px;">
	<div><img src="images/tireswing.gif" alt="Tire Swing" class="img-l" /></div>
	<h3>Tire Swing</h3>
	<p>Sue and Seymour rigged a tire swing from the tree for the kids, keeping one more tire from becoming waste and providing a great time for anybody who uses it.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="entertainment" style="width:500px;">
	<h3>Entertainment Room</h3>
	<div><img src="images/entertainment.gif" alt="Kids playing video games" class="img-r" /></div>
	<p>Of course, when the Savemors are done recycling at the end of the day, there are always reruns to watch on TV.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="guidelines" style="width:700px;">
	<h3>Guidelines</h3>
	<div><img src="images/sign.gif" alt="Poster on game room wall" class="img-r" style="margin-right:2em;" /></div>
	<p>The Savemors use some simple guidelines to reduce waste:</p>
	 <ul>
	  <li>To reduce waste, make less garbage.</li>
	  <li>Buy only what you need. Rent, borrow, or share items that aren't used much.</li>
	  <li>Sell or donate goods instead of throwing them out.</li>
	  <li>Buy non-toxic or the least toxic products available.</li>
	  <li>Buy products that use little or no packaging. Buy individually wrapped packages only when there is no alternative.</li>
	  <li>Buy reusable products, such as re-chargeable batteries.</li>
	  <li>Buy products made from recycled materials.</li>
	  <li>Buy one general housecleaner rather than a variety of products for different purposes.</li>
	  <li>Use all of the product containing toxic ingredients so there is no hazardous waste left.</li>
	  <li>When you can't use something, find someone who can. Give extra paints to theatre or civic groups, and offer extra house cleaning or gardening supplies to neighbors.</li>
	  <li>Take used motor oil, brake and transmission fluids, and antifreeze to the local gas station for recycling. Take old tires to the gas station or to the local auto wrecker.</li>
	 </ul>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="fireplace" style="width:600px;">
	<div><img src="images/firplace.gif" alt="Fireplace" class="img-l" /></div>
	<h3>Fireplace</h3>
	<p>This fireplace was made from old bricks that the family recovered from a building that was torn down.</p>
	<p>The Savemors burn logs made from pressed wood. Pressed wood, made from recycled wood scraps and sawdust, burns cleaner that most other wood-based fuels. (Open fireplaces can add pollution to the air indoors. An enclosed wood stove that burns sawdust pellets can heat a home and cut down on the amount of pollution in the air.)</p>
	<p>The Savemors listen to Recycle City air pollution control reports on the radio and stop using the fireplace when air quality warnings are issued, such as on cold nights when the temperature keeps smoke close to the ground.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="solar" style="width:700px;">
	<h3>Solar Panels</h3>
	<div><img src="images/solar.gif" alt="Solar Panels on Roof" class="img-r" /></div>
	<p>The Savemor home has solar panels to generate electricity. These panels are made up of solar cells that absorb light from the sun and turn it into electricity, which can then be used to do things like heat water and power home appliances.</p>
	<p>Solar energy is a great source of energy because it is non-polluting and renewable (meaning it won't run out)! When we use renewable energy, we can reduce our use of other forms of energy that create greenhouse gases and pollution that warm our planet and contribute to climate change.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="attic" style="width:500px;">
	<h3>Attic Insulation</h3>	
	<div><img src="images/attic.gif" alt="Attic Insulation" class="img-r" /></div>
	<p>Every house in Recycle City has an insulated attic to reduce the need for energy and to conserve heat in the winter. Insulation also keeps homes cooler during the hot summer months. The Recycle City Power Co. gives home owners a rebate for insulating their houses.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="seal" style="width:700px;">
	<h3>Air Sealing</h3>
	<div><img src="images/seal-home.gif" alt="Windows" class="img-r" /></div>
	<p>Every house in Recycle City has been weatherized by sealing all of the air leaks around doors and windows, ceiling lights, attic hatches, and pipe and wire penetrations with caulk. Sealing these air leaks saves energy by keeping heat inside the house during the winter and cool indoor air from escaping during the summer. It also makes the house more comfortable and less drafty.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
<div id="lighting" style="width:500px;">
	<div><img src="images/lighting.gif" alt="Table Lamp" class="img-l" /></div>
	<h3>Lighting</h3>
	<p>Every light bulb in Recycle City has been replaced with a more energy efficient fluorescent or LED light bulb. Citizens are saving thousands of dollars using less electricity to light their homes, streets and city buildings.</p>
