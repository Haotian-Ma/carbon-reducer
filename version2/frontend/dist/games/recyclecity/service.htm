  <h3>Vapor Recovery</h3>
  <img src="images/vapor.gif" alt="Vapor recovery " width="359" height="272" class="img-l" />
  <p>Shaq's Garage has special nozzles on its gas pumps to prevent gas fumes from escaping when people fill their gas tanks. Why does Shaq bother? Because pollution from gas fumes is even more concentrated than exhaust that comes out of a car's tailpipe. (So it's more harmful.)</p>
  <p>Gas fumes contain things like volatile organic compounds, called VOCs, and other pollutants and dangerous chemicals, like benzene, that can cause cancer. The nozzles help prevent gas fumes from getting into the air. That's important because when gas fumes mix with sunlight, smog forms. Smog, or ground-level ozone pollution, makes it harder for people to breathe. It can irritate the eyes, throat and lungs, and can make problems like asthma worse.</p>
  <p>Air pollution from cars and other motor vehicles goes everywhere. In cities, at least half of the air pollutants that become smog are caused by gas-powered vehicles or equipment. By putting a vapor recovery nozzle on the gas pump, Shaq helps reduce toxic emissions that contribute to unhealthy air.</p>
  <p>Did you know that ground-level ozone&mdash;the main ingredient in smog&mdash;has the same chemical makeup as stratospheric ozone? The difference is that the ozone layer up in the stratosphere protects life on earth from harmful ultraviolet rays, but ozone in the air we breathe is bad for our health.</p>
 </div>
</div>
<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
 <div id="pump" style="width:700px;"> <img src="images/atthepump.gif" alt="At the pump" class="img-r" />
  <h3>At the Pump</h3>
  <p>What does proper car operation and maintenance have to do with the environment? Plenty. What you drive, how you drive, how you care for your vehicle, and how you dispose of used fluids and parts affects our air and water, the safety of landfills, and even the ozone layer above the Earth that protects everyone from ultraviolet radiation. Here are some things you can do:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Use the right octane level&mdash;Using higher-octane gas may not increase the engine's performance, so don't buy a higher grade than the car engine needs. (Making fuels with higher octane uses more crude oil than lower-octane gas. Also, making higher-octane fuel often involves the addition of toxic chemicals.)</li>
   <li>Don't overfill or spill&mdash;Stop filling the tank when the pump automatically shuts off. Going past the pump's cutoff increases the chance of spilling gas and releasing harmful gas vapors.</li>
   <li>Put the gas cap on tightly&mdash;The gas cap prevents the escape of gas vapors from the fuel tank, reducing air pollution, and protects the engine by keeping water out of the fuel.</li>
   <li>Use cleaner fuels&mdash;If available in your area, use alternative fuels that can reduce air pollution. These fuels burn more completely than gasoline or are less likely to evaporate.</li>
  </ul>

		<h3>Electric Cars</h3>
		 <img src="images/electric.gif" alt="Electric Car plugged into an 'Electric Car Charging Station' charging station" class="img-r" />
			<p>This is one of the new electric cars purchased by a couple of Recycle City residents. These forward-looking folks know that in the future more car owners will be driving up to "charging stations" to refuel their vehicles with electricity. With improved battery technology, more electric cars are going as far as gas powered cars on a single charge.</p>
			<p>Electric cars are less polluting because nothing comes out of their tailpipes. This means less greenhouse gas emissions, like carbon dioxide, to warm the planet and more people breathing cleaner air, which reduces asthma, heart attacks, and other diseases.</p>
			<p>Many states have goals to increase solar and wind electricity, so these cars will charge their batteries on cleaner, less polluting energy. The government and businesses are working to shift to renewable energy power sources and improve battery recycling to make electric cars even better for the planet.</p>

 <div id="oilfilter" style="width:700px;"> <img src="images/filter.gif" alt="Changing Oil Filter" class="img-l" />
  <h3>Used Oil Filters</h3>
  <p>Oil filters are made from high-quality steel and can be recycled. Because an average used oil filter retains as much as 6 to 8 ounces of engine oil after it is removed, Shaq makes sure all the leftover oil is drained from a filter before he puts it into the bin that goes to the Materials Recovery Facility.</p>
  <p>Like the rest of the country, about 45 percent of Recycle City car owners change their own oil. When they do, they drain the oil from the used filter into a plastic milk jug and then put the filter into a plastic bag for collection. (Not all cities collect used oil filters, but you can still help the environment by taking the used filter and oil to the proper collection facility.)</p>
  <p>At the Materials Recovery Facility, used oil filters are set aside to go to a processing center, where the last drops of oil are drained and captured for recycling. Then, the steel is pressed into cubes. The cubes are sold to steel mills to be made into something new.</p>

 <div id="water" style="width:700px;"> <img src="images/streetdrain.gif" alt="Stormwater drain" width="100px" height="64px" class="img-l" />
  <h3>Protecting water quality</h3>
  <p>Waste water and storm water from auto shops can pollute waterways and put toxics, oil and grease into the sewer.</p>
  <p>Shaq prevents water pollution by minimizing spills of oil, antifreeze, solvents and gasoline. He uses shop towels to clean up small spills, and has a spill kit with special mops and absorbents to clean up bigger spills. He doesn't hose down his shop floor into the sewer, but keeps it clean with mops.</p>
 </div>
</div>
<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
 <div id="usedoil" style="width:700px;"> <img src="images/usedoil.gif" alt="graphic, Used Oil" width="116" height="120" class="img-l" />
  <h3>Used Motor Oil</h3>
  <p>Used motor oil contains lots of toxic materials. Shaq knows that recycling it is the best way to handle this kind of hazardous waste. Whenever a car needs an oil change, he collects the oil in this drum. When it's full, the truck from the oil recycling program picks it up to be &quot;cleaned&quot; and reused.</p>
  <p>Shaq also accepts used motor oil from people who change their own oil. By doing this, he knows that the used oil will be disposed of properly and won't be poured down the drain, on the ground, or into Recycle City's storm sewers, which empty into a nearby creek.</p>
  <p>If someone in your family changes the car's oil at home, make sure the used oil is taken to a local gas station, oil-change shop, or hazardous waste drop-off center. Never pour used motor oil down the sewer or into a drain, because it can flow into a creek, river or lake and poison fish, plants, and animals.</p>
 </div>
</div>
<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
 <div id="cfc" style="width:700px;"> <img src="images/cfc.gif" alt="Yellow can with 'used cfcs' on it" class="img-l" />
  <h3>Used CFCs</h3>
  <p>What are CFCs and why does Shaq's Garage collect them? For many years, car air conditioners and home refrigerators used chemical compounds called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs for short, to help produce cool air. (New cars and refrigerators don't use them.)</p>
  <p>CFCs become a big problem if they escape into the air. They float up into the stratospheric ozone layer&mdash;about 10 to 30 miles above the earth&mdash;which blocks the sun's most dangerous ultraviolet [UV] rays.</p>
  <p>Once CFCs are up in the stratosphere where it's freezing cold, they destroy ozone molecules, reducing the protective ozone layer and allowing more UV rays to reach the earth, where they can cause severe sunburn, eye damage, skin cancer, kill crops and other plants, and even destroy sea life.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, CFCs can be recycled. In the Recycle City garage, Shaq uses special equipment to capture the cooling liquids that contain CFCs from the car's air conditioner. That way, the CFCs don't escape into the air and can be used again in older cars.</p>
  <p>(Since new car air conditioners use different chemicals that don't hurt the ozone layer, CFCs will gradually become less of a problem).</p>
 </div>
</div>
<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
 <div id="ust" style="width:700px;"> <img src="images/lds.gif" alt="green box with 'ust' on it" class="img-l" />
  <h3>Underground Storage Tanks</h3>
  <p>The gasoline that Shaq sells to his customers is stored in tanks under the ground. When his station was built, Shaq used double-walled tanks with secondary containment to protect the environment from tank leaks.</p>
  <p>Secondary containment means that there are two walls of metal or fiberglass-reinforced plastic between the gasoline and the soil, so there is less chance that a leak would contaminate the soil and groundwater beneath the earth's surface. Any gasoline that leaks out of the tank will collect between these walls, where it can be detected, so the problem can be fixed before any gasoline leaks into the environment.</p>
  <p>What's a UST LDS anyway? The sign marks the location of Shaq's Underground Storage Tank Leak Detection System. The system monitors the tanks and piping so that Shaq knows right away if there's a problem. That way, he can call the experts to fix the leak before it becomes a big problem&mdash;one that could contaminate drinking water wells.</p>
 </div>
</div>
<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
 <div id="antifreeze" style="width:700px;"> <img src="images/toxic-solv.gif" style="width:98px; height:108px;" alt="image of a toxic solvent container" title="Toxic Solvents container" class="img-l" />
  <h3>Toxic Solvents</h3>
  <p>To clean parts, auto shops use a lot of solvents - liquids that dissolve other substances, like grease. Used solvents are the largest source of hazardous waste from auto repair. They also can harm workers if used improperly.</p>
  <p>Shaq has made great strides to reduce his solvent use. He uses safer water-based solvents, and makes sure these are recycled or managed by a fully-qualified waste hauler. He reads the ingredients of the products he buys and tries to avoid the most toxic chemicals. He has also replaced many spray cans for brake cleaning with a roll-around brake washer.</p>
 </div>
</div>
<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
 <div id="oldtires" style="width:700px;">
  <h3>Old Tires</h3>
  <p>Worn-out tires don't need to be thrown away. Shaq does two things to keep old tires going.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>First, he sends good tires that are still safe for use to a tire company to be reconditioned. These retreads can be put back on the car and driven safely for many more miles. </li>
   <li>When old tires can't be put back into shape, Shaq collects them and passes them on to companies that reprocess them. Old tires can be shredded or melted down and used to make other materials, such as asphalt to pave roads, or playground surfaces.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When the tires on your car wear out, don't just throw them away. If your local gas station doesn't do what Shaq's Garage does, call your local solid waste management department.</p>
  <p>Whatever you do, don't toss them into the nearest ditch or garbage can. When dumped, they can cause safety hazards, catch fire, or provide disease-carrying mosquitoes a place to breed.</p>
  <p>We have made significant progress &ndash; today 83 percent of all tires are reused, recycled, or recovered in useful ways. But thousands are still going into shrinking landfill spaces, added to rapidly growing stockpiles of tires, or dumped into creeks or empty lots.</p>
  <p>The first way to prevent generating old tires is to regularly check them to make sure they have the appropriate tire pressure; this will allow them to perform well and extend their life. If we all do this, we&rsquo;ll generate less old tires.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/tirepile.gif" alt="Old Tires" title="Pile of old tires" style="width:98px; height:72px;" /></p>

<div class="simple_overlay" style="display:none;">
 <div id="maintenance" style="width:700px;"> <img src="images/maintenance.gif" alt="Maintenance" width="210" height="309" class="img-l" />
  <h3>Maintenance</h3>
  <p>Shaq helps his customers maintain their cars in tip-top condition, and gives maintenance tips that can help their cars run better <em>and</em> help the environment.</p>
  <div style="margin-left:220px;">
   <ul>
 <li>Get regular maintenance&mdash;Follow the recommended maintenance guidelines for your car to keep it in top running condition and minimize damage to the environment. Things that need regular maintenance include air filters, oil, oil filters, vacuum and coolant hoses, spark plugs, oxygen sensors, and emission systems.</li>
 <li>Recycle used oil&mdash;The oil from just one oil change is enough to contaminate one million gallons of fresh water. Americans who change their own oil throw away 120 million gallons of reusable oil every year. Much of it contains toxic substances such as lead and benzene. Oil dumped on the ground can pollute drinking water sources underground. If you or someone in your house changes the oil, don't dump it&mdash;take it to a service station or a collection center!</li>
 <li>Check your tire pressure once a month. An underinflated tire can reduce gas mileage by two percent. </li>
 <li>Use the recommended oil viscosity (thickness)&mdash;Using the lowest recommended viscosity for the lowest expected outdoor temperatures gives you the best gas mileage, easy starts, and cold-engine protection.</li>
 <li>Use energy-conserving oils&mdash;Oil containers marked with &quot;EC&quot; numbers on the labels can improve gas mileage by one to two percent.</li>
   </ul>
